## Description

This command allows you to toggle streamer related features within Lilith. Doing `/streamer` or `/streamer toggle` will toggle streamer mode.
Streamer mode is designed to hide your Lilith usage from your screen. For more, see the [Streamer Mode](/features/streamermode) feature page.

Alternatively, if you'd like to hide aspects of your gameplay, you can use `/streamer date` or `/streamer server` to hide the date or server you are playing on in the scoreboard.
You can also replace the server name with a custom IP address using `/streamer ip [text]`. (This must be toggled on by running `/streamer ip`.)

## Usage

`/streamer [toggle]` | `/streamer <server|date>` | `/streamer ip [text]`

## Aliases

`/streamer`, 
`/lstreamer`
