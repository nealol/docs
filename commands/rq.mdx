## Description

This command will run the `/play` command associated with the gamemode you are currently playing. If in a lobby, the last played gamemode will be used.
As of Lilith 1.1, `/rq` will not work by default when a game has already started. To requeue while in a game, use `/rq force`.

While most gamemodes will work, and play commands can be updated remotely, newer gamemodes may not work as expected. Report any issues in a ticket.
Requeueing being blocked after a game start is only guaranteed to work in games supported by queuestats.


## Usage

`/rq [force]`

## Aliases

`/rq`,
`/requeue`
