description: 'An API KEY is a UUID (text string) that allows you to fetch player&apos;s stats from Hypixel&apos;s API.'

Lilith currently supports two ways of fetching this data:

-   Local fetching _(available at any tier of Lilith)_,
-   Lilith API Key Services, AKA API Key-less _(only available if you [support Lilith](https://lilith.rip/pricing))_.

## Lilith API Key Services

[Support Lilith](https://lilith.rip/pricing).

## Local fetching

<Note>
	Please note that using a Developer API Key you will need to create one every three days.

    To not be affected by this, [support Lilith](https://lilith.rip/pricing) to use Lilith API Services.

</Note>

<p>
	To use local fetching you need to use your own API Key. Here are the steps
