title: 'Getting an API Key'
description: 'Start using the Hypixel API within Lilith.'

An API key is a special password from Hypixel that allows you to fetch players' stats from their API. Many of Lilith's features are dependent on this data.

Lilith currently supports two ways of fetching this data:

-   Local fetching with your own key (available to anyone),
-   Lilith API Services (a hosted service with higher limits but less barrier to entry).

## Lilith API Services

Lilith API Services is in early alpha. To get early access, join our [Patreon](https://lilith.rip/pricing).

## Local fetching

<Note>
	Please note that using a Developer API Key you will need to create one every three days.

    To not be affected by this, [support Lilith](https://lilith.rip/pricing) to use Lilith API Services.

</Note>

<p>
	To use local fetching you need to use your own API Key. Here are the steps
